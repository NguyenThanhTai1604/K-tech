                <h1 class="exercise-title">Common Exercises</h1>
                <p class="exercise-intro">The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as
                    part of their daily
                    exercise routine.</p>

                <div class="exercise-item">
                    <h3 class="exercise-name">Burpee</h3>
                    <p class="exercise-description">Burpees are a great, full-body exercise to increase your
                        strength and endurance. Begin in a
                        standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and
                        then
                        forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="exercise-item">
                    <h3 class="exercise-name">Plank</h3>
                    <p class="exercise-description">Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a
                        push-up position and rest your
                        forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="exercise-item">
                    <h3 class="exercise-name">Mountain Climber</h3>
                    <p class="exercise-description">Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands
                        on the floor in a push-up
                        position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as
                        though
                        you are climbing a mountain).</p>
