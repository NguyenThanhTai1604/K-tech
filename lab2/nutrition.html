                        <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food.
                            Think
                            of
                            your
                            body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>
                        <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you
                            make a
                            permanment
                            change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal</p>
                        <p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help
                            track
                            your
                            activity level and calories.</p>
